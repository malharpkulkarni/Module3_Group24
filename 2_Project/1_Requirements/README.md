# BiCom System :

## Description:

  This project is an BiCom System ,A BiCom system is the extention of the unidirectional RKE to bidirectional RKE system and This system enables the transfer of data from both the ends.
 * keyfob -> car (like a unidirectional RKE system) 
 * car ->keyfob (car status information for displaying on the keyfob by LED or display) 

# Identifying features :
* It shall print window status and turn on all the led at the same time when blue switch is pressed only onces.
* It shall print alarm status and turn off all the led at the same time when blue switch is pressed twice.
* It shall print car battery information and tuen on all the led in clockwise manner when blue switch is pressed three times.
* It shall print door status and turn on all the led in anti-clockwise manner when blue switch is pressed four times.
