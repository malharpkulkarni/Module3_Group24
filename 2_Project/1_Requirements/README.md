# BiCom System :

## Description:

  This project is an BiCom System, A BiCom system is the extention of the unidirectional RKE to bidirectional RKE system and This system enables the transfer of data from both the ends.
 * keyfob -> car (like a unidirectional RKE system) 
 * car ->keyfob (car status information for displaying on the keyfob by LED or display) 

# Identifying features :
* It shall print window status and turn on all the led at the same time when blue switch is pressed only onces.
* It shall print alarm status and turn off all the led at the same time when blue switch is pressed twice.
* It shall print car battery information and tuen on all the led in clockwise manner when blue switch is pressed three times.
* It shall print door status and turn on all the led in anti-clockwise manner when blue switch is pressed four times.
